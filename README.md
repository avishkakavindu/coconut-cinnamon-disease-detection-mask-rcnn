# Mask R-CNN Model for Coconut Plant Disease Detection
This repository contains a Mask R-CNN model trained to detect diseases of coconut plants in images. The model was trained on a dataset of images of coconut plants with black spot, brown blight, and tip burn diseases.

## Usage
### Installation
To use this model, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:


> ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
###Running the Model
To run the model on an image, you can use the predictor_mrcnn.py script:
Will generate an image with the detected objects outlined and labeled.

### Training the Model
If you want to train the model on your own dataset. You'll need to modify the script to point to your dataset and set the appropriate parameters.

### Dataset
The dataset used to train this model is not included in this repository due to its size. However, the dataset can be obtained from source. It contains images of coconut plants with black spot, brown blight, and tip burn diseases, as well as annotations of the disease locations in the images.
